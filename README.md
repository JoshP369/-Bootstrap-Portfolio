# Bootstrap Portfolio

## Project Overview

This repository is dedicated to building a responsive portfolio layout using the Bootstrap CSS Framework. The main objective is to showcase my skills as a front-end web developer and create an aesthetically pleasing portfolio for potential employers.

## User Story

As a web developer, the goal is to use Bootstrap to construct a portfolio site that features essential components, including a navigation bar, hero section, projects section, skills section, and an about/contact section. The site should be visually appealing, easy to navigate, and responsive across different devices.

## Acceptance Criteria

The portfolio should meet the following criteria:

### Navigation Bar:

- A navigation bar should be present at the top, featuring links to relevant sections.

### Hero Section:

- A hero section (jumbotron) should showcase a picture of myself, my name, and additional information.

### Projects Section:

- My previous work/projects should be displayed using Bootstrap cards in a grid layout.
- Each card should have a brief overview of the project and a button linking to the deployed application.

### Skills Section:

- A list of skills I am expected to learn from the bootcamp should be displayed.

### About/Contact Section:

- There should be a summary about myself and previous experience.

### Footer:

- All hyperlinks should have a hover effect.

- All buttons should display a box shadow upon hover.

### Responsiveness:

- Ensure that the portfolio layout is responsive and adapts well to various screen sizes.
